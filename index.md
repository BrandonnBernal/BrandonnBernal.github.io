### CPSC 120 Labs

  Lab 1
  
  I think that this lab was the most important because it was the first time we were able to utilize the terminal and git repositories.
  This lab taught us the basics of git, including git clone, git push, git commit, changing the folder, and using the Clang compiler. It was also
  the first time my partner and I used the text editor, which at first was confusing, but as soon as we figured out how it worked, we were able to
  finish the lab. Additionally, it was fun to print out our first program with the classic “Hello World” phrase, which we had to replace the phrase with one of our names.

  Lab 6(Part 2)
  
  This lab was exciting and intriguing to me because we were able to program one of my favorite card games, which was Blackjack. I had
  to figure out which operator to use on the boolean statements to figure out if, for example, a card was greater than 21. My favorite part of this
  part of the lab was calculating the total card points of the ace cards. Overall, it was nice utilizing the if-else statements in this lab because it
  taught us more logical problem-solving on how to apply conditional statements to this lab.

  Lab 7(Part 1)
  
  Lab seven was the lab where we had to program in which parking spots were available on a particular day of the week. Personally, this was one of my
  favorite labs because we had to think logically about whether or not this parking space was available. On the instructions provided, we had to consider
  the hour, day, week, and place. I had trouble figuring out which operator to use, especially on the Cedar Street function. But we were able to figure it
  out by using the and/or operators in between the hours when the parking spot was available.
